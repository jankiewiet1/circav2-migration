# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

We have successfully integrated the OpenAI Model Context Protocol (MCP) into the carbon accounting platform with the following components:

### 1. MCP Types and Interfaces
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for MCP in `src/types/mcp.ts`
- Defined context schema, action types, input parameters, and output formats
- Ensured type safety throughout the application

### 2. MCP Context API
- Implemented `/api/mcp-context.ts` endpoint to provide structured context
- Added Supabase database integration for retrieving carbon data
- Implemented authentication and authorization checks

### 3. MCP Actions
- Created carbon footprint calculation action in `/api/mcp-actions/calculate-carbon-footprint.ts`
- Designed action input/output schemas following MCP specifications
- Implemented error handling and validation

### 4. MCP Server Provider
- Built a server-side MCP provider in `src/lib/mcp-server.ts`
- Added function registration and execution mechanisms
- Created a system for defining and exposing MCP actions

### 5. OpenAI Integration
- Enhanced the OpenAI client with MCP support
- Added methods for context injection and action execution
- Created utility functions for AI interactions

### 6. React Integration
- Developed `useMCP` hook in `src/hooks/useMCP.ts` for React components
- Added context fetching and action execution capabilities
- Created a seamless developer experience for AI features

### 7. Carbon Data Recognition Agent
- Updated the agent to use MCP for context and actions
- Enhanced document processing with MCP
- Added fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility

### 8. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `README-MCP-INTEGRATION.md`
- Added pull request description in `MCP-INTEGRATION-PR.md`
- Documented code with detailed comments

## Next Steps

To complete the MCP integration, we should:

1. Implement remaining MCP actions (data validation, compliance reporting, etc.)
2. Add comprehensive tests for all MCP components
3. Deploy the updated application to production
4. Monitor performance and make optimizations as needed

## Benefits of MCP Integration

The MCP integration provides several benefits to our carbon accounting platform:

1. **Structured Context**: AI models now have access to structured carbon data
2. **Standardized Actions**: All AI interactions follow the OpenAI MCP standard
3. **Enhanced Capabilities**: AI agents can perform complex carbon calculations
4. **Better User Experience**: More accurate and helpful AI responses
5. **Future-Proof**: Ready for upcoming OpenAI MCP features and improvements
