# Carbon Accounting OpenAI Assistant Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and optimize your OpenAI Assistant for carbon accounting emission calculations.

## üéØ Overview

Your OpenAI Assistant is configured to:
- **Calculate CO2e emissions** from activity data using comprehensive emission factor databases
- **Lookup emission factors** from uploaded knowledge base (DEFRA, EPA, IPCC, RIVM, etc.)
- **Classify GHG scopes** according to the GHG Protocol
- **Validate calculations** with confidence scoring and quality assurance
- **Handle unit conversions** and normalization

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You need an OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o and Assistants API
2. **Assistant ID**: Your existing assistant ID is `asst_lgIBVnkFbxotum0R29rIhTj`
3. **Knowledge Base**: Upload emission factor PDFs to your assistant's vector store

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Set Environment Variables

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### 2. Update Your Assistant

Run the update script to apply the optimized configuration:

```bash
npm run update-assistant
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Update your assistant with the new emission calculation prompt
- ‚úÖ Configure the tools for validation and classification
- ‚úÖ Set optimal parameters (temperature: 0.1, model: gpt-4o)
- ‚úÖ Test the assistant with a sample calculation

### 3. Verify Knowledge Base

Ensure your assistant has access to emission factor databases:

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/assistants)
2. Find your assistant: `asst_lgIBVnkFbxotum0R29rIhTj`
3. Check that the "Carbon Accounting Knowledge Base" vector store contains:
   - ‚úÖ DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors 2024
   - ‚úÖ EPA Emission Factors
   - ‚úÖ IPCC Guidelines
   - ‚úÖ RIVM Emission Factors
   - ‚úÖ Other relevant emission factor databases

## üîß Assistant Configuration

### Core Capabilities

Your assistant is optimized for:

```json
{
  "emission_factor_lookup": "Search comprehensive databases",
  "precise_calculations": "Activity Data √ó Emission Factor = CO2e",
  "ghg_scope_classification": "Scope 1, 2, 3 according to GHG Protocol",
  "unit_conversions": "Handle all common carbon accounting units",
  "quality_assurance": "Confidence scoring and validation",
  "source_validation": "Cross-reference multiple databases"
}
```

### Input Format

The assistant expects emission entries in this format:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "company_id": "uuid", 
  "date": "2024-05-27",
  "category": "fuel",
  "description": "Diesel fuel for company vehicles",
  "quantity": 100,
  "unit": "liters",
  "scope": 1,
  "notes": "Fleet vehicles"
}
```

### Output Format

The assistant returns calculations in this format:

```json
{
  "emission_factor": 2.68,
  "emission_factor_unit": "kg CO2e/liter",
  "total_emissions": 268.0,
  "emissions_unit": "kg CO2e",
  "scope": 1,
  "source": "DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors 2024",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "calculation_details": "100 liters √ó 2.68 kg CO2e/liter = 268.0 kg CO2e",
  "warnings": [],
  "emission_breakdown": {
    "co2": 240.5,
    "ch4": 15.2,
    "n2o": 12.3
  },
  "factor_metadata": {
    "factor_id": "DEFRA_2024_DIESEL",
    "year": 2024,
    "region": "UK",
    "category": "Transport Fuels"
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Assistant

### Test Single Calculation

```bash
npm run test-assistant
```

### Test in Your Application

Use the `AssistantEmissionCalculator` service:

```typescript
import { AssistantEmissionCalculator } from '@/services/assistantEmissionCalculator';

const calculator = new AssistantEmissionCalculator();

// Test single entry
const result = await calculator.testSingleEntryCalculation(companyId, false);
console.log('Test result:', result);

// Calculate for specific entries
const results = await calculator.calculateSelectedEntries(
  companyId, 
  ['entry-id-1', 'entry-id-2']
);
```

## üìä Data Processing Workflow

### 1. Emission Factor Lookup
- Assistant searches uploaded knowledge base
- Matches activity description to appropriate factors
- Considers geographic and temporal relevance
- Validates against multiple sources

### 2. Calculation Process
```
Activity Data √ó Emission Factor = Total CO2e Emissions
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.9-1.0 (exact), 0.7-0.9 (good), 0.5-0.7 (approximate)
- **Validation Checks**: Reasonable emission intensities, unit compatibility
- **Warning Flags**: Unusual values, outdated factors, missing data

### 4. Scope Classification
- **Scope 1**: Direct emissions (fuel combustion, company vehicles)
- **Scope 2**: Purchased energy (electricity, steam, heating)
- **Scope 3**: Value chain emissions (travel, purchased goods, waste)

## üéØ Supported Activity Types

### Fuel Combustion (Scope 1)
- Diesel, petrol, natural gas, LPG
- Company vehicles, heating systems
- Generators, equipment

### Electricity (Scope 2)
- Grid electricity by country/region
- Renewable energy certificates
- Steam, heating, cooling

### Transportation (Scope 3)
- Business travel (flights, trains, cars)
- Employee commuting
- Freight transportation

### Other Activities
- Waste disposal and treatment
- Water consumption
- Purchased goods and services
- Industrial processes

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Assistant Not Found (404)**
   - Verify assistant ID: `asst_lgIBVnkFbxotum0R29rIhTj`
   - Check OpenAI API key permissions

2. **Low Confidence Scores**
   - Upload more specific emission factor databases
   - Provide more detailed activity descriptions
   - Check unit compatibility

3. **Missing Emission Factors**
   - Ensure knowledge base contains relevant databases
   - Update with latest emission factor releases
   - Add region-specific factors

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in your application:

```typescript
// In your environment variables
VITE_DEBUG_ASSISTANT=true
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing
- Process entries in batches of 5-10 for safety
- Use progress callbacks for user feedback
- Implement retry logic for failed calculations

### Cost Management
- Use test mode for development
- Implement calculation limits
- Cache common emission factors

### Accuracy Improvement
- Regularly update emission factor databases
- Collect user feedback on calculations
- Monitor confidence scores and warnings

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Updates
1. **Monthly**: Update emission factor databases
2. **Quarterly**: Review and improve prompts
3. **Annually**: Update GHG Protocol compliance

### Monitoring
- Track calculation accuracy
- Monitor API usage and costs
