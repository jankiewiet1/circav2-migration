# Real OpenAI Assistant Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Replace Demo Mode with Real OpenAI Assistant

Currently your system is running in **Demo Mode**. This guide will help you set up a **real OpenAI Assistant** for actual carbon accounting calculations.

## Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
5. **Important**: Add some credits to your OpenAI account (minimum $5-10 recommended)

## Step 2: Set Environment Variable

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

## Step 3: Create the Assistant

Run the assistant creation script:

```bash
# Set your API key for the script
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

# Create the assistant
npm run create-assistant
```

You should see output like:
```
ðŸ”‘ OpenAI API key found: sk-proj-abc...
